I am trying to figure out what is wrong with the parsing of the SOLR query for edge weights.

Also trying to figure out why the new parsing gives a different graph edges/nodes than the old parsing with the same data.

Right now I suspect the ordering of the kmer graph. To try to get similar results I have taken to ordering the kmer graph so the processing ordering will be the same.
I am testing the solr_parsing branch with a new OrderedDict vs. a branch of master (with old parsing) also using OrderedDict. The results are going into a folder called test_ordering.

The previous results will remain as new_data_old_parsing etc.
